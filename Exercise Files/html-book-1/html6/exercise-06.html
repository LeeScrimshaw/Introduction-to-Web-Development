External Links


Links are a vital part of every html document. For example a link to the BBC Sports website, may be useful for sports fans wanting to check the latest sports news.


A link direct to a certain part of BBC Sports, such as the Formula One page or the Football Gossip is also possible if we have the full address (URL).


The text you use for the link is very important. If you took away the text surrounding links above, would the link text make sense on its own?


You should read more about writing good link text at the WebAIM article  Link Text and Appearance.
