<h2>About me.</h2>

<p> I'm a Quality Engineer at a large retail bank, currently living and working in Halifax, West Yorkshire.</p>

<p> After graduating from the University of York in 2010, I have spent the past 10 years performing Testing and Quality Assurance roles within the Financial Services industry, primarily focusing on Debit Cards and related payment technologies. </p>

<p> <strong>Notable projects include:</strong> Apple Pay, Android Pay, Contactless Payments and Ring-Fenced Banking. </p>

<p> Alongside my role, I am currently studying Digital and Technology Solutions at Manchester Metropolitan University. </p>

<p> Owing to the UK wide lockdown restrictions, you will most likely find me at home with my Wife and two cats: Albus & Jasper. Iâ€™m a keen footballer, CrossFit newbie, Kopite, part-time PC gamer and <em>full-time </em> food enthusiast. </p>
